# Task: Define Advanced Agentic Roadmap

## Origin
User request to replace the current backlog with a new one focused on advanced features (OAuth, Agent Mapping, Visual Workflows).

## Objective
Design and document the new technical roadmap for the "Advanced Agentic" phase.
This involves defining the architecture fields for:
1.  **OAuth Authentication** for LLMs.
2.  **Agent-Model Mapping** (Binding semantic roles to specific models).
3.  **UI Enhancements**: Agent filters, Task Timeline, Workflow Visualizer.

## Contract
- **Agent**: architect-agent
- **Strategy**: Long Lifecycle (This is a foundational definition task).
