# Task Candidate

## Task Description
The user requests a review of the backlog status based on the current project state. The current `ROADMAP-BACKLOG.md` appears outdated (last audit Feb 15, but valid significant work has occurred since then, including CI fixes, E2E tests, and generic refactoring).

## Objective
Update `ROADMAP-BACKLOG.md` to accurately reflect the current completion status of tasks, specifically key domains like D8 (E2E), D3 (Backend), and D7 (CI/CD), and identifying any new tasks or completed items from recent history.
