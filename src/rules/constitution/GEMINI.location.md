# GEMINI LOCATION

This repository DOES NOT version `GEMINI.md`.

Google Antigravity loads `GEMINI.md` from the user path (outside the repository).
Therefore, the agentic system assumes that `GEMINI.md` exists and is accessible on the local machine.

## Rule

- `GEMINI.md` is PERMANENT and has absolute priority.
- This file only documents where `GEMINI.md` is located and how it integrates.
- `GEMINI.md` MUST NOT be copied or duplicated within the repository.

## Minimum Requirements

- The developer machine MUST have `GEMINI.md` available in the user path configured for Google Antigravity.
- If `GEMINI.md` is not available, any task MUST BE BLOCKED until the environment is corrected.

## Internal Reference

Repository rules reference the global constitution via:

`constitution.GEMINI_location`

This file acts as the unique versioned anchor point for the external `GEMINI.md` constitution.
